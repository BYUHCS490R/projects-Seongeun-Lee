    <h1>Final Proposal</h1>
    <p>The title is "Ridy: A Ride-Sharing App" and the topic is general overview of this business and market research.</p>
    <p>The reason for choosing this topic is for me to improve this business idea. My husband and I brought this idea to the Great Ideas Competition, and it wasn't successful.</p>
    <p>On the home page, I will explain the general business idea and the information about us. On the first page, I will explain the problem which caused us to come up with this idea. On the second page, I will discuss the solution which will be detailed information about Ridy, the business. On third page, there will be some market research and strategy. On forth page, I will outline the financial plan. On the last page, I will provide a web page link for the demo version of Ridy service, and also a form to get feedback, and also for contact information to send a message when the service is launched.</p>
    <p>There will be at least name, email, comment, and phone fields in the form. The table will be to compare my service and other similar services.Also, table can be used for the financial plan.</p>
    <p>I want to have the percentage of I-work student from the official BYUH web page. I will use the number of cars passing the highway near Laie from the Hawaii government website.</p>
    <p>I did read and understand the warnings.</p>
