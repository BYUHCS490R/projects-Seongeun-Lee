        <h2>Yang-Yang</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="emph">Yang-yang-ee</span> is the first and the last cat I had in my house. In 2012, my father randomly called me to come outside. Since his voice was unusually calm, I though I had done something wrong. When I went out, there was a little kitten and my worried father. He knew that my mom would be upset if she realized that he brought an animal to the house. We were very unprepared for Yang-yang-ee and had lack of information back then. However, Yang-yang-ee was able to adjust to our home, and the time with him was the best time ever in my life. He is the reason I fell in love with cats.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            Even though I love watching and playing with cats, and even had had a cat in my house before, I wonder if cats are truely happy staying home with humans. To me, cats raised by humans seem like children with parents who obsess over high education and high-income professions. The parents believe they are helping their kids, however, the kids end up with a fixed mindset, and lack of sleep and experience. In my opinion, cats feel happy enough, when they have their natural lives even if there are many trials and hazards outside.

            A relative link has some part of the full link, and often used when you share a link which is from the same root. <a href="../profile.html">An example of a relative link</a> On the other hand, an absolute link is the full address, and can be just any links. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">An example of an absolute link</a>
