    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>Internet is what connects all the computers to communicate.</p>

    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>Web is a service that people can use through internet. If internet is roads where people walk around, web is like a restaurant people stop by.</p>
    
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>I already explained it for question 2. Like my professor said, people often mixed up using "internet" and "web." 
        They say that "Go search on the internet," in fact, people uses internet to search on websites.</p>

    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>Both are for computer to understand for human languages. 
        ASCII has 128 characters but it can only express English. 
        On the other hand, Unicode has various encoding way, and it represent multiple languages. </p>
    
    <h2>What is UTF-8</h2>
    <p>It is the encoding method that people use nowdays. </p>
    
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>It tells the location on the internet like an address starting from "Https."  </p>
    
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>It is a part of URL like google.com. If URL is the whole, detailed address, domain name is the name of a building. 
    
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>It is a rule which computers need to follow when communicating on the web.</p>
    
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>It is more secure version of HTTP.</p>
    
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>It means an address that the computer has when it is connected to the internet.</p>
    
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>It gives IP address from domain name.</p>
    
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>It is a standard rule from W3C. Because of this standard, you can see websites from any browwer. </p>
    
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p> HTML is the language for web pages. When you want to add videos, you use HTML5, the recent one. 
        XML is for storing datas, not for creating beautiful web pages. Lastly, XHTML is HTML following XML rules. </p>
