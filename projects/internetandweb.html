    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>Internet is what physically connects all the computers to communicate.</p>

    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>Web is a service that people can use through internet. If internet is roads where people walk around, web is like a restaurant people stop by.</p>
    
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
