                    <p>This is me, the writer. I am a student majoring in computer science at BYU-Hawaii. I love math and science because it helps me understand the world and nature better. Computer science is pretty new to me, but I am excited to continue the journey.</p>

                    <p>This is my little brother. Gi-Yoon is also considerate but also very introverted. He really likes Japanese animation, board games, and computer games. He also likes math and is good at it, but he doesn't enjoy studying. He is not particularly interested in becoming financially successful, but he is still responsible and reliable.</p>
