    <h1>Hello, my name is Seongeun Lee</h1>

    <p>In Korea, after-school programs are a huge thing. Parents are busy working, so they send their kids to the programs for studying math, English, music, art, sports, etc. For me, it was a piano school. I was 6 years old on my first day, and I immediately fell in love. <mark>Playing the piano</mark> has been a great, passionate hobby to me for the last 17 years.</p>

    <p>Besides playing alone, I also enjoyed spending time with my little brother. We used <mark>to create stories</mark> and to act. One day, when I have the time and skills, I will bring them to the life through AR or VR. It would be <em>beautiful</em> like the movie <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>. <br>Here are some of my other interests: </p>

    <ol type ="A">
        <li>Nature</li>
        <li>Listening to music</li>
        <li>Cats&amp;Small animals</li>
        <li>Food in different countries.</li>
    </ol>
