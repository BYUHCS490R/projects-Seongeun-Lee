    <h1>Hello, my name is Seongeun Lee</h1>

    <p>In Korea, after-school program is a huge thing. Parents are busy working, so they send their kids to the program for studying math, english, music, art, sports, etc. For me, it was a piano school. I was 6 years old on my first day, and I immediately fell in love. <strong>Playing the piano</strong> has been a great, passionated hoppy to me for last 17 years.</p>

    <p>Besides playing alone, I also enjoyed spending time with my little brother. We used <strong>to generate stories</strong> and to act. One day, if I have time and skill or money, I want to realize it through AR or VR. It will be beautiful like the movie The Chronicles of Narnia. <br> Here are some of my other interests: </p>

    <ol type ="A">
        <li>Nature</li>
        <li>Listening to music</li>
        <li>Cats</li>
        <li>Food in different countries.</li>
    </ol>
