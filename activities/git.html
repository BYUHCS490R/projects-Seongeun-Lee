    <h1>Help</h1>
    <p>1. I can get help from the tutors and the professor. </p>
    <p>2. Engagement assignments are due at 11:59 pm on Mondays and Fridays. I cannot turn them in late. If I miss it, I will lose my points. </p>
    <p>3. Projects are due on Wednesdays before 5 am. I can't turn them in late, but I have four resubmission chances. If I do not submit it, there will be no point.</p>
    <p>4. We did't discuss any tags today. We worked on cloning and committing. Since we used the same tags from the last week to make a page, nothing was specifically pointed out.</p>
