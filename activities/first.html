    <h1>My First Page</h1>
    <p> 1. The internet connects computers in order to communicate with each other. 
        The web is what is provided through the internet. 
        It is possible that a user uses web A to contact a friend using web B through the internet.</p>
    <p> 2. Git is a tool or a system where you record and save your code. 
        GitHub is where you share your code. Other people can also access your code and edit it. 
        I think it is quite similar with Google Docs and Google Drive. 
        You make your own document in docs and upload it to drive for others to use or modify it. 
        GitHub is used for team projects. </p>
    <p> 3. Does this question mean the whole code? I will copy and paste this code on the comments section.
    <p> 4. Html tells the beginning and the end of the html document. You can assign the basic language through this tag. 
        head has information about page, not the letters that users see on the page.
        meta charset="UTF-8" means the standard form of character.
        The next tag decides how the page will look like. Without this tag, the whole page will be shown on the screen, and the letters will be too small.
        title shows the name of the page. 
        body is the most part of the information or the screen. 
        h1 is the largest heading tag. 
        p makes a paragraph. </p>
    <p> 5. Yes, I did. </p>
