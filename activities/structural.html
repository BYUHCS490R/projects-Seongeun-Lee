        <p>2. What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website? <br>The Nav has links to go to other pages which users often look for. The Nav can go anywhere, however, it usually goes in, above, or below the header for. The nav could contain another website but it is not common because people do not want users to leave their website. If the other websites are from the same company, they would have it.</p>
