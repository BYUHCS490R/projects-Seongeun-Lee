        <h2>An Absolute Link</h2>
        <p>
            In Pres. Nelson's talk he talked about peace <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson?lang=eng">Talk</a>
        </p>

        <h2>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</h2>
        <p>
            Root is where all the folders locate. When you create a webpage, it is located in a folder in your root. The path tells you the name of the file for the webpage, and the name of the folder containing the file.
        </p>

        <h2>What is a default document?</h2>
        <p>
            If you go to the root of the address, you will only see the list of folders. If you want to have an actual webpage for the root, you can add file called a default document in your root and design it.
        </p>

        <h2>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h2>
        <p>
            An absolute link has the full address, and a relative link has only the part of the address from which the addresses starts to differ. I would use relative links because it is shorter and convenient.
        </p>

        <h2>A Relative Link</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="first.html">First page</a>
        </p>

        <h2>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>

        <h2>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
        <p>No, it can be almost anywhere in body.</p>
