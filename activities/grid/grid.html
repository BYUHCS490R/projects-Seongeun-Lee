                <p class="child">A parent is an outer box like a container, and a child is an inner box which can be also a parent of other boxes. This relationship is essential to understand how grid or flex works. For example, my organs can be arranged within my body though it is not good for me. However, I cannot arrange my heart and myself, unless I take my heart from the body and they become elements of the world.</p>
                <p class="child">I believe that this topic wasn't covered today. But I asked AI, and here is my understanding. First, in the way boxes are arranged, Grid is like a coordinate plane, while Flexbox is like a number line. Second, Grid creates a designed layout first and then places the content. On the other hand, Flex adjusts the displayed size based on its content.</p>
