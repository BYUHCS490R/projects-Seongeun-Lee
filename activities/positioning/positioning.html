        <h1>Positioning</h1>
        <p>My dear brothers and sisters, how we treat each other really matters! How we speak to and about others at home, at church, at work, and online really matters. Today, I am asking us to interact with others in a higher, holier way. Please listen carefully. “If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy” that we can say about another person—whether to his face or behind her back—that should be our standard of communication.</p>

        <h3>What is normal flow in HTML?</h3>
        <p>Flow is the order and the way that contents are placed in the main. In the normal flow, contents are displayed based on the order of the tag you write. If it is an inline tag, the line won't break.</p>
        
        <h3>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h3>
        <p>When you make the tag float, other box like paragraph can come next, horizontally. But sometime you want to decide how many boxes beside the tag, in that case, you should clear it.</p>

        <h3>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h3>
        <p>If the position is fixed, it doesn't move at all even when you scroll down the screen. If the position is absolute, it ignores the document flow and is positioned based on the number of px. If the position is relative, the flow doesn't change, so the boxes above or below remain same.</p>
 
        <h3>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h3>
        <p>I can set the image's position as 'fixed.'</p>

        <h3>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h3>
        <p>I can find videos in the lecture notes in the modules.</p>
